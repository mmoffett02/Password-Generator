# Password-Generator
This file uses Javascript to make randomly generated passwords between 8 and 128 characters.
The website uses window prompts to alert the user and have them make their selections on password specifications. 
The user has the option to select the exact amount of characters between 8-128 characters, and the option to choose if special, numeric, uppercase, or lowercase characters will be selected. 
If the user inserts a character count outside of the 8-128 character range, they will be alerted that the selection must be within that range before proceeding.
